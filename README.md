# Spam Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to build and evaluate a spam detection model. The goal is to classify messages as either "spam" or "ham" using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Converting text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms.
- **Model Training**: Training machine learning model for spam classification.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
